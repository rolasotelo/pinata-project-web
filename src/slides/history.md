# A very Brief History of Mexico ü¶ï

I'll try not to bore you

## The meteorite

The first notable thing taking place in Mexico was the strike of a meteorite that caused a mass extinction of the dinosaurs. The meteorite was named Chicxulub. The crater is the largest impact crater in the world and is located in the Yucatan Peninsula.

### I discovered something cool when writing 'chicxulub crater' on google. Try it yourself.

## First civilizations

Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire, was founded by the Aztec or Mexica people around 1325 C.E. According to legend, Huitzilopochtli directed them to build where they saw an eagle perched on a cactus, eating a snake.

### Now you can understand better the national coat of arms of Mexico at the center of the flag.

#### What about the Mayans?

## The New Spain

New Spain was a colonial territory of the Spanish Empire. It was established following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521.
