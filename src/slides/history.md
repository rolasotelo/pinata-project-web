# A very brief history of Mexico ðŸ¦•

I'll try not to bore you

## The meteorite

The first notable thing taking place in Mexico was the strike of a meteorite that caused a **mass extinction of the dinosaurs**. The meteorite was **named Chicxulub**. The crater is the largest impact crater in the world and is located in the Yucatan Peninsula.

### I discovered something cool when writing 'chicxulub crater' on google. Try it yourselves.

## First civilizations

Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire, was founded by the Aztec or Mexica people around 1325. According to legend, **Huitzilopochtli** directed them to **build where they saw an eagle perched on a cactus, eating a snake**.
