# We actually have a lot of things to share!

But it is not that difficult to imagine, I mean we are a huge country.

## Las Pi√±atas

#### Dale dale dale, no pierdas el tino ...

The origin of pinatas in Mexico go back to  1586. They were originally created for Christmas and were made of clay. They are filled with candy, fruits, and nuts.

### Have you ever before hit a pinata?

## Dia de Muertos

It has its origin in the cult to the dead, which was practiced by indigenous people. It is celebrated on November 1st and 2nd.

## Mariachi

There is disagreement about the origin of the word Mariachi, but some music historians believe that it is derived from the French word mariage, meaning "wedding,".

A mariachi orchestra is composed of at least two violins, two trumpets, a Spanish guitar, and two other types of guitars, the vihuela, and guitarron.

No matter where you go you can always find a mariachi band. And Prague is no exception.

## Polka in Mexico

There is even a book about it!  "Polka, ra√≠ces de una tradici√≥n musical" by Radko Tichavsk√Ω

"En la regi√≥n del norte y noreste de M√©xico, la gente considera a la polka como su danza nacional, como su emblema cultural"

Czechs and Germans in Texas opposed to the expatriation of Mexicans from Texas. Which made possible the creation of Tex-Mex culture and later Burritos üåØ.

### Are Czechs the true reason for the existence of burritos?
