#### Are we lazy if we use AI?

#### Did you feel like an artist?

#### Who is the real author of the images?

#### Should I use AI to do my homework?

#### Where is the real value of AI?

#### Can AI really make the world a better place?

#### Is it ok if I don't know how AI works and just use it?

#### What is the future of art?

#### Who should make rules for AI?

#### Is AI a threat to humanity?

## I asked AI to tell me what should we be worried about, regarding AI

There are several reasons why humans should be concerned about the potential of AI:

* **Job displacement**: As AI becomes more advanced, it has the potential to replace human workers in certain industries. This could lead to massive job displacement and economic disruption.
* **Bias and discrimination**: AI algorithms are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on, and if that data is biased or discriminatory, the AI will be too. This could lead to unfair treatment of individuals or groups based on factors like race or gender. 
* **Lack of accountability**: Unlike humans, AI systems are not capable of moral reasoning or ethical decision-making. This means that they could make decisions that are harmful or unethical without any accountability. 
* **Security risks**: As AI becomes more advanced, it could be used to carry out cyber attacks or other malicious activities. This could pose a significant threat to national security and personal privacy. 
* **Unintended consequences**: As with any new technology, there is always the potential for unintended consequences. AI systems could have unforeseen negative effects on society or the environment that we are not yet aware of.

While AI has the potential to bring many benefits to society, it is important to approach its development and deployment with caution and consideration for its potential risks and impacts.
