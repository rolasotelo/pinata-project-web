# Mexican food or a tale of corn üåΩ and beans ü´ò

The milpa is a traditional agricultural system of Mesoamerica, in which successive cycles of crops are grown in the same field. The milpa is a combination of **corn, beans, chilli, squash**, and other crops.

Milpa is at the center of Mexican diet and plates. And **corn is the most important crop** in the milpa.

#### But what do Mexicans do with corn?

I mean, it's not like they use it for every single meal. Right?

Well, they do ü§™

## Tacos and other meals with Vitamin T

Eating with your hands is part of all these mexican dishes. And street food is a big thing back home.

## My favorite: Chiles en Nogada

The favorite dish of my girlfriend and also mine. It's a dish from Puebla, Mexico. It's a poblano chile stuffed with a lot of stuff. It's topped with pomegranate seeds and parsley.

## Tex-Mex or Mexican-American cuisine

Maybe you are more familiar with Tex-Mex or Mexican-American cuisine. It's a fusion of Mexican and American cuisine. But not very popular in Mexico.

* „Éª**Burritos** üåØ are the flagship dish of Tex-Mex cuisine. I also love them.
* „Éª**Nachos** are also a staple of Tex-Mex cuisine.
* „Éª**Chimichangas** are a deep-fried burrito, I have never tried them.
* „Éª**Hard shelled tacos** üåÆ are a popular dish in the United States, but not in Mexico.

### Did you know chocolate, vanilla, pineapple (no it's not Hawaiian), and tomatoes are all native to Mexico?

So if we invented tomato sauce, are we on our right to put pineapple on pizza?
